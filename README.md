# Crossplane Function JS

A JavaScript function for Crossplane that enables executing inline JavaScript/TypeScript code in compositions.

## Overview

Crossplane Function JS is a specialized Crossplane function that allows you to write JavaScript/TypeScript code directly in your compositions. It consists of a Go gRPC server that receives requests from Crossplane and manages Node.js servers that execute the JavaScript/TypeScript code.

The architecture is designed for robustness and isolation:

- The Go server acts as a proxy between Crossplane and the Node.js servers
- Each unique piece of inline code gets its own isolated Node.js server instance
- Node.js servers are lazy instantiated based on the hash of the inline code
- Unused Node.js servers are garbage collected to conserve resources

### Components

1. **Go gRPC Server**: Receives requests from Crossplane, manages Node.js processes, and forwards requests.
2. **Process Manager**: Manages the lifecycle of Node.js processes, including creation, health checking, and garbage collection.
3. **Node.js Servers**: Execute JavaScript/TypeScript code from compositions.

## Features

- **Inline Code Execution**: Write JavaScript/TypeScript code directly in your compositions
- **Code Isolation**: Each piece of inline code runs in its own Node.js server for robustness
- **Optional Dependencies**: Specify npm dependencies for your inline code (recommended for development only)
- **Optional Inline yarn.lock**: Include a yarn.lock file in your composition for dependency version locking
- **CLI Tool**: Generate composition manifests with inline code from source files

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with Crossplane installed
- Helm 3+

### Installing the Helm Chart

```bash
# Install the chart
helm install crossplane-function-js oci://ghcr.io/socialgouv/helm/crossplane-function-js --version 0.0.2
```

For more details on chart configuration options, see the [chart documentation](charts/crossplane-function-js/README.md).

## Development

### Prerequisites

   direnv allow
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

## Usage

### Creating a Composition with Inline Code

Here's an example of a composition that uses inline JavaScript code:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Composition
metadata:
  name: example-composition
spec:
  compositeTypeRef:
    apiVersion: example.org/v1alpha1
    kind: XExample
  pipeline:
    - step: transform-with-js
      functionRef:
        name: function-xfuncjs
      input:
        spec:
          source:
            inline: |
              export default async function(input) {
                // Your JavaScript/TypeScript code here
                const composite = input.observed.composite.resource;
                
                // Transform the input
                const transformed = {
                  // Your transformed resources
                };
                
                return {
                  resources: transformed
                };
              }
```

### Using the CLI to Generate Compositions

The CLI tool can be used to generate composition manifests from source files:

1. Create a directory structure for your functions:

   ```
   functions/
   ├── example1/
   │   ├── composition.fn.ts
   │   ├── package.json (optional)
   │   └── composition.yaml (optional)
   └── example2/
       ├── composition.fn.ts
       └── package.json
   ```

2. Run the CLI tool:

   ```bash
   npx @crossplane-js/cli gen-manifests
   ```

3. This will generate composition manifests in the `manifests/` directory.

#### Customizing Compositions

By default, the CLI uses a template for generating compositions. However, you can provide your own template by creating a `composition.yaml` file in the same directory as your `composition.fn.ts` file.

If you create a custom template, you should maintain the following placeholders if you want to preserve the substitution functionality:

- `__FUNCTION_NAME__`: Will be replaced with the name of the function directory
- `__FUNCTION_CODE__`: Will be replaced with the content of the `composition.fn.ts` file
- `__DEPENDENCIES__`: Will be replaced with dependencies from package.json
- `__YARN_LOCK__`: Will be replaced with the content of yarn.lock

#### Dependencies and yarn.lock Handling

The CLI handles dependencies and yarn.lock files as follows:

- **Dependencies**: By default, the `__DEPENDENCIES__` placeholder will be replaced with dependencies from the `package.json` file in the same directory as the `composition.fn.ts` file. If no `package.json` exists in that directory, it will use dependencies from the `package.json` in the parent directory (the one containing the `functions` directory).

- **yarn.lock**: Similarly, the `__YARN_LOCK__` placeholder will be replaced with the content of the `yarn.lock` file in the same directory as the `composition.fn.ts` file. If no `yarn.lock` exists in that directory, it will use the `yarn.lock` from the parent directory.

This approach allows you to have function-specific dependencies or share dependencies across all functions.

## Testing

The project includes end-to-end tests that use a Kind cluster to verify functionality:

```bash
# Set up the test environment
task setup-test-env

# Run the end-to-end tests
task e2e-test

# Clean up the test environment
task clean-test-env
```

The tests:

1. Set up a Kind cluster with a local registry
2. Install Crossplane
3. Deploy the XFuncJS server
4. Apply test compositions and resources
5. Verify that the resources are created correctly
